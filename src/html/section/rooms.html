        <p>
          Start your session off with some weight training to build physical strength and conditioning. Our equipment
          includes a variety of weightlifting machines and free weights that allow boxers to work on their endurance,
          power, and explosiveness. In this space, boxers can perform exercises that will help them improve their
          punching power, footwork, and overall athleticism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weight room is often a hub of activity in the gym, with boxers of all skill levels and experience levels
          working together to push themselves to their limits and become the best version of themselves.

          Our cardio room contains a mixture of treadmills, stationary bikes, and ellipticals. This room is designed to
          help boxers improve their cardiovascular endurance, which is critical for sustaining high-intensity boxing
          workouts and fights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our jump ropes and medicine balls help boxers work on their agility, coordination, and speed. Cardio training
          is a key component of a boxer’s training regimen, as it helps them to maintain their energy levels throughout
          a fight and recover more quickly between rounds.
        </p>
        <p>In the cardio room, boxers can work on their fitness goals in a focused and supportive environment, with
          access to the equipment they need to take their training to the next level.</p>

        </div>
        <p>
          Change rooms and lockers are an essential part of any boxing gym, providing a secure and private space for
          boxers to change and store their personal belongings during their workouts. The change room typically contains
          a row of lockers or cubbies, each assigned to a particular boxer, where they can store their gym bag,
          clothing, and any other personal items they bring to the gym.

        </p>
        <p>
          We have separate change rooms for men and women, with separate shower and bathroom facilities. Having a
          dedicated space to change and store belongings can help boxers feel more comfortable and organized, allowing
          them to focus on their workouts without worrying about the safety of their personal belongings. It’s also a
          great opportunity for boxers to socialize and bond with their fellow gym members before and after their
          training sessions.

        </div>
        <p>
          Steam rooms provide a range of health benefits, including relaxation, detoxification, and improved
          cardiovascular health. Boxers can use the steam room to help relieve sore muscles and joint pain after a tough
          workout, or to unwind and de-stress after a long day. The heat can also help to increase blood flow, which can
          improve cardiovascular health and boost the immune system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many boxers find that using the steam room regularly helps them to feel more relaxed and energized, and can
          even help them to sleep better at night. We consider it to be a vital gym facility, providing boxers with a
          space to unwind and rejuvenate their bodies and minds.
